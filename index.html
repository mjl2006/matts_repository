  <h1>Writing Assignment</h1>
  <p>1. An example of a software that I have personally used recently that I think was designed well is Minecraft: Java Edition. 
    I think the software is great compared to the bedrock edition of Minecraft as it allows for multiplayer gameplay, 
    online gameplay, better graphics, quality, animations, etc. I have played Minecraft with my peers many times and the 
    software runs perfectly, there are never any bugs and glitches no matter what games we play. A simple reason why 
    Minecraft developers and the software itself runs so perfectly all the time is because bugs are detected very fast, 
    and the game itself is constantly being updated to avoid complaints from players because of big errors in the servers. 
    This is why I chose Minecraft: Java Edition, as an example of a software that I have used that is designed well, 
    because it runs good, bugs are fixed all the time, servers on all consoles run perfectly, and there is never any 
    confusion when trying to run servers in the game. 

2. Software design is very important and necessary when programming as it ensures a well-functionable program, which 
    satisfies all users' experience when playing a certain game, such as Minecraft, that has a successful program. 
    Designing a software outlines the many different components that are a part of the program, overall structuring 
    and organizing the program to perfection. Therefore, this is the reason why software design is crucial when programming, 
    as it ensures satisfaction in users' experience, and overall structures a program with all of its components, 
    whether it is making a video game, a website, etc.

  <p>Programming isn’t only about the code itself, but it must be designed for satisfaction in order for the 
    software to be good, as in a software, programming is only one step of the process. The first stage in programming,
    before you start a software program, is the requirements gathering stage. This stage consists of certain 
    requirements that the software must follow, with a follow-up description. These descriptions for each requirement 
    explain in depth how the software should run, how it should look, and what the main functions inside the software 
    are. Some examples of some functions for a software is a sign-in page for an educational website. Or a date 
    selection page for reserving seats at a restaurant on a website. If the functions are followed properly and the 
    software doesn’t follow what the user is trying to accomplish on the program, the users won’t be satisfied. 
    This is why the requirements gathering stage in software design is very crucial when making a software, as it 
    allows for user satisfaction, and overall helps build the software from ground up. 
</p>
  <p>In the writing assignment 1, I talked about Minecraft: Java Edition. Here are 5 user stories for this software: 
1. As a user, I want a settings page, so that I can change certain functions of the gameplay.
2. As a user, I want an online store, so that I am able to purchase modifications for the game.
3. As a user, I want a friends list, so that I am able to connect with friends online, and add more friends. 
4. As a user, I want a server list, so that I can access all my servers and create new ones. 
5. As a user, I want a customization page, so that I can customize and change my skins and other accessories to my liking. 
</p>

  </Writing Assignment 3>
  <p> 1. The software product from my Writing Assignment 3 is Minecraft: Java Edition.
</p>
  <p>
2. Here is a persona for a potential user for the software Minecraft: Java Edition:

Persona: 

Name: Jacques Stroll
Age: 15 years old
Gender: Male
Location: Montreal, Quebec 
Occupation: McDonald’s Cashier
Income: $20,000/year
Education: Currently Enrolled in a Secondary School

Background information: Jacques Stroll was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, he still currently lives there 
and just started 10th grade at a public secondary school. Jacques enjoys hanging out with his peers and family, 
and loves to game. He really loves this one game, called Minecraft. He has been playing Minecraft ever since he 
was a kid. Jacques prefers the Java edition of Minecraft over the Bedrock edition as it allows for more multiplayer 
and interactive in-game experiences, overall shaping the way the game should be made and played. 

Goals: Expressing the love for the game by testing new worlds, realms, and game modes and testing out the 
newly developed multiplayer experience in the Java edition of Minecraft.

In-game difficulties: Bugs and game delays happen often, due to too many servers and players happening 
all at once, fortunately, the Minecraft developers are ahead of those bugs and fix them almost immediately. 

Game availability: Minecraft is available on many devices, such as tablets, pc’s, cellular devices, 
and gaming consoles. But unfortunately, since the Java edition is newer than the Bedrock version of 
Minecraft, Minecraft: Java Edition is only accessible for pc users. 

Traits: Allows for creativity when in creative mode, broadens the minds of users, in survival mode, 
teaches users about real world survival skills, with accurate real world applications, with many 
unrealistic challenges to enhance the overall uniqueness of the software.

  <Writing Assignment 4>
  <p>Communication is very important in software design, as it allows for explicit collaboration within a group. 
    Software designers and developers require a team with great communication skills so they are able to assist 
    each other out with tasks within a software. There are many steps through the software design process where 
    communication is key, such as the requirements stage, and the brainstorming stage. With communication comes 
    good listeners, if you are clear with ideas and understandable, your group of people you might be working with 
    will follow through with your brainstorming, which is the first key of communication, clarity. Being a good 
    listener also follows suit under communication, as in order to work as a team, someone needs to be communicating, 
    and someone needs to be listening and understanding so that everyone is on the same page through the software 
    development process, which is the second key of communication, listening. And the third and final key to 
    effective communication is response. Being a good member of a team means bringing valuable responses and 
    feedback towards a group, which will effectively improve the performance of a software development team. 
</p>
  <p>An instance where I have been through a communication issue was on a group presentation back in high school.
    The main problem was there were very few communicators, and not a lot of ideas for that specific project was 
    being brought up. I myself were speaking thoroughly within the group, but many weren’t. I think I could’ve 
    done a better job by including everyone even the ones who were not speaking, to try and make the group project 
    more valuable and interesting to those not speaking, to bring everyone together as one to aim to all collaborate 
    and efficiently communicate with one another. 
</p>
   <Writing Assignment 5> 
  <p>A crucial design principle is consistency, which is referred to making sure of uniformity in a software to 
    make it more understandable for users of that software. Within software design, consistency ensures users know 
    what they are reading or viewing, overall taking away the confusion part throughout softwares. This makes 
    applications and softwares have better user experience and more satisfaction. For example, from the health and 
    fitness app my group and I made in lab 9, if every button is simplistic, and easy to read, users will find it 
    easy to navigate through the application and find all the features, without the aspect of confusion. I’ve 
    firsthand seen the design principle of consistency being used in many other applications, like social media, 
    where all of the buttons are simple, and easy to understand, like the like button, the comment button, sharing, 
    favourting, and more. This eliminates users confusion within softwares. Therefore, by using the design principle 
    of consistency with all softwares, this ensures little to no confusion for the users.
